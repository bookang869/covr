// This is your Prisma schema file,
// learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

// Looking for ways to speed up your queries, or scale easily with your serverless or edge functions?
// Try Prisma Accelerate: https://pris.ly/cli/accelerate-init

// Prisma turns this file into SQL migrations and a type-safe PrismaClient

// schema.prisma has 3 main sections:
// 1. Generators -> tell Prisma how to generate the Prisma client (what to output)
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js" // Generate a TS client library sos I can do import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client' in my code.
  output   = "../src/generated/prisma"
}

// 2. Data sources -> tell Prisma which DB to connect to and how
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

// 3. Data model -> describe your tables (called models), enums, and relationships
