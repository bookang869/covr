## ‚ùì Open Questions Requiring Your Input

1. ~~**External APIs**: Do you have preferences for specific security news APIs or RSS feeds for breach monitoring?~~  
   ‚úÖ **Resolved**: Will use the most secure API that integrates well with our tech stack (likely RSS feeds from reputable security sources like CISA, CVE databases)

2. ~~**File Storage**: Should we implement CloudFront CDN from the start, or add it later for performance optimization?~~  
   ‚úÖ **Resolved**: Add CloudFront later for performance optimization, start with direct S3 serving

3. **Notification Preferences**: What's your priority order for notification channels? (Slack, Email, In-app)

4. **Risk Scoring**: What specific factors should contribute to the computed risk score beyond risk level and data sensitivity?

5. **Organization Onboarding**: Should new users automatically create an organization, or should there be an invitation-only flow?

6. **Document Types**: Are there specific compliance document types beyond SOC 2 and ISO that should be supported from day one?

7. **Deployment Timeline**: Do you need a staging environment, or is development ‚Üí production sufficient?
